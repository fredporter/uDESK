# PANEL System Guide

The uDESK PANEL system provides the main desktop interface through four integrated panels aligned to the **uDOS Grid System** (16×16 pixel uCELL architecture).

## 🎛️ Four Core Panels

### 📝 TodoPanel
**Live TODO Management with VSCode Integration**

Features:
- **Real-time TODO parsing** from workflow files
- **Progress tracking** with visual completion status
- **VSCode synchronization** with TODO Tree extension
- **Action buttons** for starting/completing TODOs
- **Workflow file editing** directly from panel

Use Cases:
- Track development progress
- Sync with VSCode TODO Tree
- Manage milestone assignments
- Edit workflow files on-the-fly

### 📊 ProgressPanel
**Workflow Hierarchy Visualization**

Features:
- **Goal→Mission→Milestone→TODO** hierarchy display
- **Expandable milestones** with progress bars
- **Real-time statistics** and completion tracking
- **Script integration** for hierarchy management
- **Interactive navigation** through workflow structure

Use Cases:
- Visualize project progress
- Navigate complex workflows
- Track milestone completion
- Execute hierarchy scripts

### ⚙️ WorkflowPanel
**VSCode Command Center & Script Execution**

Features:
- **VSCode commands**: Terminal launching, file operations, TODO Tree refresh
- **Script execution**: Direct execution of core workflow scripts
- **Custom commands**: Advanced workflow automation input
- **Action categories**: Organized command groups (Workflow, VSCode, Progress, System)

Use Cases:
- Launch VSCode terminals in workspace context
- Execute workflow automation scripts
- Refresh TODO Tree and file operations
- Custom workflow command execution

### 🖥️ SystemPanel
**Development Environment Integration**

Features:
- **Development integration**: VSCode workspace management
- **System monitoring**: Resource usage and environment status
- **Script access**: Quick execution of system health scripts
- **Terminal integration**: Launch terminals in development context

Use Cases:
- Monitor development environment
- Quick system health checks
- Launch development terminals
- Access system scripts

## 🔗 VSCode Integration Features

### Core Integrations
- **🔄 TODO Tree Sync**: Automatic refresh of VSCode TODO Tree extension
- **📂 File Operations**: Open workflow files directly in VSCode editor  
- **💻 Terminal Integration**: Launch terminals in uDESK workspace context
- **📋 Command Execution**: Run workflow scripts through VSCode interface
- **⚡ Task Management**: Create and execute VSCode tasks from panels

### Workflow Data Processing
- **📊 Live Parsing**: Real-time parsing of workflow files and hierarchy
- **📈 Progress Tracking**: Automatic progress calculation and milestone completion
- **🏆 Milestone Management**: Hierarchical organization with expandable views
- **🔧 Script Integration**: Direct execution of uDESK core workflow scripts

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### Daily Development Workflow
1. **Check TodoPanel** for current tasks
2. **Review ProgressPanel** for milestone status
3. **Use WorkflowPanel** to execute scripts and VSCode commands
4. **Monitor SystemPanel** for environment health

### Project Management
1. **Navigate hierarchy** in ProgressPanel
2. **Track completion rates** across milestones
3. **Execute workflow scripts** for automation
4. **Sync with VSCode** for development tasks

### System Integration
1. **Launch VSCode terminals** from panels
2. **Refresh TODO Tree** after workflow changes
3. **Execute health checks** via SystemPanel
4. **Monitor resource usage** during development

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### uDOS Grid Alignment
- All panels align to **16×16 pixel uCELL** architecture
- **Consistent spacing** and **proportional scaling**
- **Grid-based positioning** for optimal layout
- **Responsive design** adapting to screen sizes

### Data Flow
```
Workflow Files → workflowDataService → Panel Components → VSCode Integration
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓                ↓
Core Scripts → Live Parsing → Real-time UI → Command Execution
```

### Service Integration
- **workflowDataService**: Parses workflow files and builds hierarchy
- **vscodeIntegrationService**: Handles VSCode commands and task management
- **uDeskDataService**: Manages panel data and state
- **udosGridSystem**: Provides layout and positioning services

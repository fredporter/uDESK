# uDOS uDOS Example Workflows

This directory contains example workflows demonstrating uDOS AI automation capabilities.

## Workflow Categories

### ðŸ”„ **System Maintenance**
- `daily-backup.json` - Automated daily data backup with notifications
- `system-health.json` - Comprehensive system health monitoring
- `cleanup-routine.json` - Regular cleanup and optimization tasks

### ðŸ’» **Development Workflows**  
- `git-workflow.json` - Automated git operations with AI suggestions
- `build-deploy.json` - CI/CD-style build and deployment automation
- `code-analysis.json` - Automated code quality and security checks

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart-Assisted Tasks**
- `smart-organization.json` - Smart-powered file organization
- `learning-workflow.json` - Self-improving workflow that learns from usage
- `context-aware.json` - Workflow that adapts based on current context

### ðŸ”— **Integration Examples**
- `m2-m3-integration.json` - Multi-milestone integration workflow
- `external-tools.json` - Integration with external tools and services
- `notification-hub.json` - Centralized notification management

## Usage

With Node.js installed, you can:

1. **List workflows**: `udos m4 workflow list`
2. **Create from example**: `udos m4 workflow create "$(cat daily-backup.json)"`
3. **Execute workflow**: `udos m4 workflow run <workflow-id>`
4. **Get AI suggestions**: `udos m4 ai suggest`

## Best Practices

- Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity
- Use conditions to prevent unnecessary executions
- Implement proper error handling with fallback actions
- Leverage AI learning by running workflows regularly
- Test workflows thoroughly before production use

## Template Integration

Use uDOS templates to generate workflow configurations:
```bash
udos m4 template generate workflow-definition
udos m4 nlp "create a backup workflow for daily use"
```

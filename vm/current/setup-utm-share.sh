# UTM Shared Folder Usage Guide

## Setup Complete!

Your TinyCore VM now has UTM shared folder support configured.

## Commands

### Mount/Unmount
```bash
mount-utm-share          # Mount shared folder
unmount-utm-share        # Unmount shared folder
```

### File Transfer
```bash
copy-from-mac [dest]     # Copy from Mac to TinyCore
copy-to-mac <source>     # Copy from TinyCore to Mac
```

### Manual Access
```bash
ls /mnt/shared           # List shared files
cd /mnt/shared           # Navigate to shared folder
```

## UTM Configuration

1. **UTM VM Settings** ‚Üí **Sharing**
2. **Add Directory** ‚Üí Select folder to share
3. **Share name**: Use "udeskshare" or "share"
4. **Save and restart VM**

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Install uDOS from shared folder
copy-from-mac /tmp
cd /tmp && tar xzf udos-offline-bundle.tar.gz
cd udos-offline && ./udos-offline-install.sh

# Copy logs to Mac
copy-to-mac /var/log/messages

# Access files directly
nano /mnt/shared/config.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check mount status
mountpoint /mnt/shared

# Check available shares
cat /proc/mounts | grep 9p

# Re-mount manually
unmount-utm-share && mount-utm-share

# Check UTM VM settings for shared directories
```

## Auto-Mount

The shared folder will automatically mount on boot.
No manual intervention required after setup.

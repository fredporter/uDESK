```
🌟 GOAL → 🎯 MISSION → 🏆 MILESTONE → ⚡ MOVE → 📋 TODO
```

#### **🌟 GOAL (Ultimate Purpose - Years)**
- Your lifelong direction: "Personal Growth Through Systems Mastery"

#### **🎯 MISSION (Strategic Goal - Months)**  
- Major objectives: "Build uDESK Educational Platform"
- Concrete, achievable outcomes (2-6 months)
- Clear success criteria and deliverables

#### **🏆 MILESTONE (Major Checkpoint - Weeks)**
- Significant achievements: "Express Dev Mode Complete"
- 1-4 week deliverables with clear acceptance criteria
- Visible progress markers for the community

#### **⚡ MOVE (Action Sequence - Days)**
- Coordinated task groups: "Implement Sprint Progress Tracking"
- Logical work sequences (1-7 days)
- Related TODOs grouped together

#### **📋 TODO (Individual Task - Hours)**
- Specific, actionable items: "Create progress visualization function"
- Single-focus work (1-8 hours)
- Ready for immediate development

#### **Using the Workflow System:**
```bash
# Express Dev Mode (Recommended for new contributors)
./core/express-dev.sh
# Choose EXPRESS mode for AI-guided development

# Manual workflow management
./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh show           # View complete hierarchy
./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh goal create    # Create ultimate purpose
./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh mission create # Create strategic goal

# Traditional TODO management
./core/workflow.sh todo list                # View active TODOs
./core/workflow.sh todo add "Description"   # Add new TODO
```

#### **Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature

# Work with uDESK workflow tools
./core/express-dev.sh  # For guided development

# Test your changes
./build.sh test

# Commit with workflow context
git commit -m "feat: complete TODO-XX for MILESTONE-YY (Personal Growth objective)"

# Push and create a Pull Request
git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
```

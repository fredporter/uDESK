./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh show           # View complete hierarchy
./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh goal create    # Create ultimate purpose
./core/workflow-hierarchy.sh mission create # Create strategic goal

# Traditional TODO management
./core/workflow.sh todo list                # View active TODOs
./core/workflow.sh todo add "Description"   # Add new TODO
```

#### **Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature

# Work with uDESK workflow tools
./core/express-dev.sh  # For guided development

# Test your changes
./build.sh test

# Commit with workflow context
git commit -m "feat: complete TODO-XX for MILESTONE-YY (Personal Growth objective)"
